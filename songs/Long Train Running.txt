"Long Train Running"

Down around the corner
About a half a mile from here
See the long trains running
Watch 'em disappear
Without love, where would you be right now
Without love

I thought I saw Miss Lucy
Down along the tracks
She lost her home and family
And she won't be coming back
Without love, where would you be right now
Without love

Well, the Illinois Central
And the Southern Central Freight
Gotta keep on pushing Mama
'Cause you know they're running late
Without love where would you be now?
Without love

Well, the Illinois Central
And the Southern Central Freight
Gotta keep on pushing Mama
'Cause you know they're running late
Without love, where would you be now?
Without love

Well the pistons keep on turning
The wheels go 'round and 'round
The steel rails are cold and hard
For the mountains they go down
Without love, where would you be now?
Without love, ooh…
Where would you be now

Mmm, moving on
Moving on
We’re moving on
Yeah moving on
Gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep moving on
Say
Down around that corner
About a half a mile from here
We are moving on
Moving on
Without love…
Where would we be now
