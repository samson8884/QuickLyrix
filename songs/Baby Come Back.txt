"Baby Come Back"

Come back
Baby, come back
Come back
Baby, come back

This is the first time until today
That you have run away
I'm asking you for the first time, baby
Love me enough to stay

Stay
Stay
Hey!

Come back
Baby, come back
Come back
Baby, come back

B-b-b-b-bye, bye, bye, bye
B-b-b-b-bye, bye, bye, bye

I must admit I was a clown
To be messin' around
But that doesn't mean
That you have to leave town (Come back)

Yes, and give me one more try
'Cause a love like this should-a never ever die (Come back)

Yes wi' me colour TV
And me CD-collection of Bob Marley (Come back)
Yes, wi' me bag a sensi
And we can be together for eternity

There ain't no use in you crying
'Cause I'm more hurt than you
I shouldn't been out flirting
But now my love is true

Oooh
Oooh
Oooh!
(Come back)

Every time me think of my Liza (Baby, come back)
Water come-a me eye (Come back)
Every time me think of my Liza (Baby, come back)
Water come a me eye-a

But she gone
And she not come back
Me beg her please
'Pon me knees and she still never stop

Ready she ready, eh
And a gone, she gone
She and the man with the removal van
Come on

Come back, baby, don't you leave me
Baby, please don't go
Oh, won't you give me a second chance
Baby, I love you so

Oh
Oh
Oh!
Ohoho!

Come back
Baby, come back (Come back, man)
Baby, come back
Baby, come back (Come back, Liza)

Baby, come back (Don't leave me)
Baby, come back (I cry, man)
Baby, come back (Come back, baby)
Baby, come back (Baby, don't blow)

Baby, come back (Bring back my CD-collection)
Baby, come back (Bring back me sensi)
Baby, come back (Come back, don't leave me like this)
