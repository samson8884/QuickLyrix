"What A Wonderful World"

I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, "What a wonderful world"
I see skies of blue, clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself, "What a wonderful world"

The clouds of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Also on the faces of people passin' by
I see friends shakin' hands
Sayin', "How do you do?"
They are really sayin', "I love you"

I hear babies cry and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself, "What a wonderful world"

Oh, I think to myself, "What a wonderful world"
