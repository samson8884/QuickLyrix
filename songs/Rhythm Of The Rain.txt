"Rhythm Of The Rain"

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again

The only girl I ever loved has gone away
Looking for a brand new start
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her he took my heart

Rain please tell me now does that seem fair
For her to steal my heart away when she don't care
I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far away

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again

The only girl I ever loved has gone away
Looking for a brand new start
Little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart

Rain won't you tell her that I love her so
Please ask the sun to set her heart a glow
And rain in her heart and let the love we know start to grow

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been
Ah I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again

Rain please tell me now does that seem fair
For her to steal my heart away when he don't care
I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far away

Oh listen to the falling rain
Oh rhythm of the falling rain
Oh listen to the falling rain
Oh rhythm of the falling rain
