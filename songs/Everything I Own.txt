"Everything I Own"

You sheltered me from harm
You kept me warm
Kept me warm

You gave my life to me
You set me free
Set me free

The finest years I ever knew
Where are the years I had with you?

I would give anything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

You taught me how to love
Body and soul
Body and soul

You never said too much but still you showed the way
And I knew
What you knew

Nobody else could ever know
The part of me that can't let go

I would give anything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

Is there someone you know?
You're loving them so
But taking them all for granted
You may lose them one day
Someone takes them away
And they don't hear the words you long to say

I would give anything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

Just to touch you once again
