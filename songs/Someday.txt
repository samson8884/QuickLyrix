"Someday"

In my search for freedom
And peace of mind
I've left the memories behind
Wanna start a new life
But it seems to be rather absurd
When I know the truth
Is that I always think of you

[Chorus:]
Someday someway
Together we will be baby
I will take and you will take your time
We'll wait for our fate
Cos' nobody owns us baby
We can shake we can shake the rock

Try to throw the picture out of my mind
Try to leave the memories behind
Here by the ocean
Wave's carry voices from you
Do you know the truth
I am thinking of you too

[Chorus:]
Someday someway
Together we will be baby...

The love we had together
Just fades away in time
And now you've got your own world
And I guess I've got mine
But the passion that you planted
In the middle of my heart
Is a passion that will never stop
