"No Woman No Cry"

No, woman, no cry (4)

Cause I remember when a we used to sit
In a government yard in Trenchtown,
Oba - obaserving the 'ypocrites - yeah! -
Mingle with the good people we meet, yeah!
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we have lost
Along the way, yeah!
In this great future, you can't forget your past;
So dry your tears, I seh. Yeah!

No, woman, no cry;
No, woman, no cry. Eh, yeah!
A little darlin', don't shed no tears:
No, woman, no cry. Eh!

Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown, yeah!
And then Georgie would make the fire lights,
I seh, logwood burnin' through the nights, yeah!
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge, say,
Of which I'll share with you, yeah!
My feet is my only carriage
And so I've got to push on through.
Oh, while I'm gone,
Everything's gonna be all right! (8)

[Chorus] x (2)

**** "Stir It Up" ****

Stir it up; little darlin', stir it up. Come on, baby.
Come on and stir it up: little darlin', stir it up. O-oh!

It's been a long, long time, yeah!
(stir it, stir it, stir it together)
Since I got you on my mind. (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Oh-oh!
Now you are here (stir it, stir it, stir it together), I said,
it's so clear
There's so much we could do, baby, (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Just me and you.

**** "Three Lil Birds" ****
"Don't worry about a thing,
'Cause every little thing gonna be all right.
Singin': "Don't worry about a thing,
'Cause every little thing gonna be all right! "

Rise up this mornin',
Smile with the risin' sun,
Three little birds
Pitch by my doorstep
Singin' sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true,
Sayin', ("This is my message to you-ou-ou: ")
-------------------------

**** "Can't Help Falling In Love With You" ****

Wise men say - Only fools rush in,
But I can't help falling in love with you.

Shall I stay - Would it be a sin,
But I can't help falling in love with you.

As the river flows, gently to the sea
Darling so we go, some things were meant to be

Take my hand - Take my whole life too,
But I can't help falling in love with you.
-------------------------

**** "Red Red Wine" ****

Red, red wine, Goes to my head
Makes me forget that I, Still need her so

Red, red wine, It's up to you
All I can do, I've done
But memories won't go, No, memories won't go

I'd have sworn, That with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, Now I find
Just one thing makes me forget
-------------------------

**** "Angel" ****
Girl you're my angel...

**** "Kingston Town" ****
The night, seems to fade, but the moonlight
