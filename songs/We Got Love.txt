"We Got Love"

You, You got me
We got somethin' everybody else can see
Me, I got you
We got a good thing honey you know we do

Friends, they all know
'cause we can't help but let it show
Smiles, we can't hide
We got somethin' just too good to hold inside

[CHORUS]
We don't need no money, honey you and I
What we've got together, money just can't buy
What we've got, there's plenty of
I've got you, you've got me, we got love.

[Instrumental]

Time, Moves along
And honey we just keep on a keepin' on
'cause love, makes us strong
As long as we've got love, We can't go wrong

[CHORUS]
