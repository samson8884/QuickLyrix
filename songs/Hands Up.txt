Hands Up

Hands up, baby, hands up
Gimme your heart, gimme, gimme your heart
Give it, give it

Hands up, baby, hands up
Gimme your heart, gimme, gimme
All your love, all your love

Angel face, I love your smile
Love your ways, I like your style
What can I do to get closer to you?

Don't think twice or count to ten
Don't take advice, don't ask me when
Just come my way, simply kiss me and say

Hands up, baby, hands up

With your head up in the sky
Every day you're walking by
Why don't you ever start looking at me?

Stop that game, don't waste your time
For all your dreams are matchin' mine
No use to play hide and seek for a week

Hands up, baby, hands up

Let me be your Romeo, your wonder boy
And your super champ
Let me take you to the Milky Way
On a holiday, on a holiday

Follow me
(Follow me)
Why don't you follow me?
(Why don't you follow me?)
Just come my way simply kiss me and say

Hands up, baby, hands up
