"I Need More Of You"

Hearts burning, like devilly fire
Flames changin my love to desire
say, my heart is screamin to say:
Girl, we got to go on away.

I need more of you, changin my rain into sun
more of you, put on my blues on the run
I need more of you, darling, I need more love you
More, anything less wouldn't do.

We, ain't we together too long
Strange, how did our love get so strong
there's nothing to keep us apart
we got to catch up our hearts

I need more of you, changin my rain into sun
more of you, put on my blues on the run
I need more of you, darling, I need more love you
More, anything less wouldn't do.

I need more of you, changin my rain into sun
more of you, put on my blues on the run
I need more of you, darling, I need more love you
More, anything less wourdn't do.
