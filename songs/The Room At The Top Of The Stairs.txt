"The Room At The Top Of The Stairs"

Well, I know a place where love comes easy
And I know a woman who meets me there
She takes my hand, and gently leads me
And we go up to the room at the top of the stairs

I close the door and she pulls the curtain
When we make love, it's a private affair
I've been around and I know for certain
There ain't no room like the room at the top of the stairs

When we climb up the stairway to heaven
We find love waiting there
Right at home, oh, just me and my baby
The loving's good in the room at the top of the stairs

When we climb up the stairway to heaven
We find love waiting there
Right at home, just me and my baby
The loving's good in the room at the top of the stairs

Yeah, I know a place where love comes easy
And I know a woman who meets me there
She takes my hand, and gently leads me
And we go up to the room at the top of the stairs
'Cause the loving's good in the room at the top of the stairs
